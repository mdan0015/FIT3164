Please go through pre-processing notebook file first so that the steps can be understood and check for mistakes

To experiment with omics data
You can: 

1. Experiment with either transcriptomics or proteomics data by trimming the FINAL_multi_omics_gdsc1_iso_morgan dataset accordingly.

2. Use the pre-processing script as motivation and baseline to use with other omics found

3. Use the pre-processing code as motivation to come up with your own multi-omics data


All in all, we need to expand more than to just breast cancer, because as shown in the pre-processing, we only have 42 different cancer cell lines.
