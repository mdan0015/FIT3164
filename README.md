### Multi-Omics Machine Learning Model for Predicting Chemoresistance:
Predictive modeling using machine learning allows the generation of predictive biomarkers for chemotherapeutic response and targets for new chemotherapeutics agents. Integrated analysis with multi-omics data is a rising strategy that could complement the ML tasks by combining heterogeneous and large-scale genomic datasets. This project aims to build a predictive model for chemoresistance in cancer cell lines using integrated multi-omics data and ML approaches. An improved algorithm will be proposed and demonstrated through a prototype.
